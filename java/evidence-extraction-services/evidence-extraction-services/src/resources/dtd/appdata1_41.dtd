<!-- A countdata element contains at least one typedesc element and a   -->
<!-- number of cntset elements. A typedesc element contains a number of -->
<!-- type elements, each having a unique id attribute and a string      -->
<!-- value describing the data type. A cntset element has three         -->
<!-- attributes for the name of the counter, the data set start time    -->
<!-- and the save interval delta. The starttime is given in seconds     -->
<!-- since the epoch, delta is given in seconds. A cntset contains a    -->
<!-- number of cntgroup elements, each in turn containing a number of   -->
<!-- cnt elements carrying data for one save interval. A cnt element    -->
<!-- has one attribute describing the data type id and a value that     -->
<!-- gives the actual count.                                            -->
<!--                                                                    -->
<!-- This specification can be used for event driven data collection as -->
<!-- well as time driven. In that case, each cntgroup should be given a -->
<!-- timestemp. With timestamps in the cntgroup elements, the cntset    -->
<!-- starttime and delta may be ignored (but must still be included).   -->
